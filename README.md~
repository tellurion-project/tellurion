Intro
-----
Quartz is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin. Quartz has a rapidly changing Proof of Work and Proof of Stake system, and it's first goal is to test an evolving POS system and observe it's effects on the blockchain and in the altcoin marketplace.

Quartz is built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPCoin, Novacoin, and BitcoinDark, with a modified POS system.

Short: QTZ

Algorithm SHA256


RPC Port: 21451
P2P Port: 21454



90 Seconds Per Block
100 Blocks to Confirm
20MB Blocksize


Block Reward Schedule - Proof of Work Phase
-------------------------------------------
Block 1 to 100
    0 QTZ - ANTI INSTAMINE - (sha256 diff adjustment period)

Block 101 to 700
    500 QTZ
